## ITMD 362, Production Problem 01: Pairing Typefaces

Let’s start with something fun: a typeface-pairing game.

1. Go to the TypeConnection game at http://www.typeconnection.com/. Play it until you arrive at
   three successful pairings. Record their URLs below:

   1.http://www.typeconnection.com/step5/eb.php
   2.http://www.typeconnection.com/step5/kj.php
   3.http://www.typeconnection.com/step5/xy.php

2. Next, head over to https://fonts.google.com/ and develop a pairing of Google Fonts that
   parallels one of your successful pairings from the TypeConnection game. The typefaces you choose
   on Google Fonts can (and probably will) be completely different from the TypeConnection pairing
   you’re mimicking, but you should use one of the four pairing strategies from TypeConnection: Rely
   on Family, Seek the Similar, Embrace the Other, or Explore the Past. See
   http://www.typeconnection.com/strategies.php for a description.

   You should use not only your eyeballs for this exercise, but also the information provided on
   Google Fonts for each typeface. For example, there is a lengthy bit of history and description
   for the Lato typeface on its About tab: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato#about Use that
   information to strengthen and justify your choice for pairing one typeface with another.

3. Make a record of your paired typefaces here (Name and URL on Google Fonts):

   Typeface One:
     - Name:Cardo
     - URL:https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo?query=cardo
   Typeface Two:
     - Name:Libre Franklin
     - URL:https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin?query=libre

4. Next, here in the `pp-01` directory, work with the starter HTML file to set up some content to
   show off your pairing and explain briefly why you chose the typefaces you did. The most basic
   HTML would be a heading and a short paragraph of explanatory text. But challenge yourself to be
   imaginative. Maybe you have a short paragraph of explanatory text complemented by a pull quote, a
   piece of information about one or both of your typefaces, or something else.

5. When you’re happy with your content, return to Google Fonts and select your pairings for use in
   your example HTML (you’ll need to load your Google Fonts with the URL provided).

6. Next, get to work with the starter CSS file. It opens with the minified Eric Meyer Reset
   CSS file found at https://gist.github.com/profstolley/b1f851e061f98fcbc0e41d39adc32847#file-reset-min-css
   Be sure to begin your own styles *below* the reset styles.

7. Finally, set up your fork of the Production Problems to serve your work on GitHub pages. See
   https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site
   Other Production Problems will require you to serve your work, so choose the root of your
   Production Problems repository for the publishing source.

When it comes time to discuss this Production Problem on Basecamp, be sure to share the GitHub Pages
