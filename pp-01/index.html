  <h1>Cardo and Libre Franklin</h1>
  <div>
    <p>The header in this scenario, Cardo, is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists, whereas the paragraph text, Libre Franklin, is an interpretation and expansion of the 1912 Morris Fuller Benton classic.</p>
    <p>Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists. It also works well for general typesetting in situations where a high-quality Old Style font is appropriate. Its large character set supports many modern languages as well as those needed by scholars. Cardo also contains features that are required for high-quality typography such as ligatures, text figures (also known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters.</p>
    <p> Libre Franklin is an interpretation and expansion of the 1912 Morris Fuller Benton classic. The Libre Franklin project is led by Impallari Type, a type design foundry based in Rosario, Argentina. </p>
