## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=11t0u0kuCxm8xR1j5BDDImwP3ca

Your Rationale: I chose yellow as a main color because when I think of a console game, I think of an image of people gathering, playing games, and being happy. So I selected yellow, which is associated with energizing and happiness.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=50-0u0krb++3x+OgG+qUE+ISAr1
Your Rationale: Chicago is a very cold city, so the impression of spring is greater. So, I chose a color that catches people's attention with the theme of tulip color.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33R0u0krb++3x+OgG+qUE+ISAr1
Your Rationale: This is an app for kids so in order to catch children's attention, I chose high chroma rather than pastel color.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a3T4U0kkHfVbDCGgzozoZ8Sw434
Your Rationale: When thinking about cybersecurity, dark colors come to mind than brighter colors. So I chose lower value.
